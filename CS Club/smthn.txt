-How the fixed program works:
at the start of execution, get a list of all primes from 1 to 1000 to refer to 
throughout execution (each input number is
guaranteed to be less than or equal to 1000)
read in the number of trials
for each trial:
	read in the inputs into a new array
	calculate the LCM of the array by:
		getting the prime factors of every number, with the 
		number of occurances of each prime
		find the maximum number of occurances in each prime 
		throughout the array
	return a number that is equal to the product of the maximum number of occurances of each prime
